SDL\_gpu is a C library based on SDL that makes hardware-accelerated 2D graphics easy.  It is intended as an alternative to SDL\_Renderer with modern features which may not belong in the SDL core.

Features:
  * Cross-platform (tested on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android)
  * Works with SDL 1.2 and SDL 2.0 - Great for transitioning to SDL2
  * Simple initialization
  * Virtual resolution control to separate drawing logic from display resolution
  * Image loading of popular image formats and from SDL\_Surfaces
  * Render-to-texture
  * Clear abstraction for textures (GPU\_Image) and render targets (GPU\_Target)
  * Rotation and scaling
  * Primitive shape rendering (points, lines, circles, polygons, etc.)
  * Integration with native API (e.g. OpenGL) calls
  * 2D camera control
  * Custom renderer support
